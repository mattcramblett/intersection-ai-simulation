Lab 6 Readme
Matt Cramblett & Matias Grotewold

This lab presents a complex intersection simulation involving pedestrians and vehicles. 
The work for the lab happened in three phases:
- Appearance (finding buildings, trees, cars, people etc.), primarily during week 1 with some minor tweaks later
- Vehicles - controlling the movement of vehicles and then implementing interactions with other vehicles and pedestrians 
- Pedestrians - controlling the movement of pedestrians and then implementing interactions with other pedestrians and vehicles

The latter two phases provided the bulk of the work in weeks 2 and 3, as well as over Thanksgiving Break. 

The final simulation surpassed the original goal. Instead of having only a single intersection as was originally planned, there are three intersections and a pseudo-random algorithm for generating and re-generating vehicles as they leave the constraints of the scene. That being said, many difficulties were nonetheless encountered, including finding a way to make the vehicles not drive on top of each other and also in controlling the flow of pedestrians and traffic so as to minimize collisions. 

Provided additional time, possible areas for expansion would include 2-way roads throughout, crowding of pedestrians as they wait at a crossing or a more complex road system. Given the time provided, the provided simulation is a significant accomplishment that minimizes concerning situations, such as collisions.
